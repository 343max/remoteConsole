if you ever developed some webapps for the iPhone, you will have noticed the lack of good console.log and console.dir commands.

remoteConsole tries to resolve this problem by sending the output of console.log and console.dir to a different browser of your choice: include client.js.php in your webapps html file, open monitor.html in the browser of your choice and open the debug console (like Firebug). Voila, all* is shown there.

Try it by opening monitor.html in Firefox and opening Firebug and then opening test.html on your iPhone.

*Known Bugs:
- doesn't work for large or recursive objects which are hard to json.stringify.
- when you are calling multiple console.* commands in a short period of time, they may not appear in your monitor in the same order they where sent.
